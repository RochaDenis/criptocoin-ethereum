## Overview

DIO Token Is An ERC20-Compliant Token Written In Solidity. This Project Demonstrates The Implementation Of A Simple ERC20 Token With Basic Functionality Such As Transfer, Approval, Allowance, And Burning Tokens. The Smart Contract Is Designed To Operate On The Ethereum Blockchain.

## Features

- Total Supply: The Contract Creates A Fixed Supply Of 10 Tokens At Deployment.
- Balance Management: Token Balances Are Managed On A Per-Address Basis.
- Token Transfer: Allows Token Transfer Between Addresses.
- Approval And Allowance: Enables Delegation Of Token Transfers By Approving Third-Party Addresses.
- Token Burning: Users Can Permanently Destroy Tokens, Reducing The Total Supply.

## Prerequisites

Before You Begin, Ensure You Have The Following Installed On Your Local Machine:

- Node.js And npm
- Truffle Or Hardhat (For Deploying Contracts)
- Ganache (For Local Blockchain Simulation)
- MetaMask (For Interacting With The Blockchain)
