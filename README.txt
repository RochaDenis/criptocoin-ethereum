## Overview

DIO Token is an ERC20-compliant token written in Solidity. This project demonstrates the implementation of a simple ERC20 token with basic functionality such as transfer, approval, allowance, and burning tokens. The smart contract is designed to operate on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Features

- Total Supply: The contract creates a fixed supply of 10 tokens at deployment.
- Balance Management: Token balances are managed on a per-address basis.
- Token Transfer: Allows token transfer between addresses.
- Approval and Allowance: Enables delegation of token transfers by approving third-party addresses.
- Token Burning: Users can permanently destroy tokens, reducing the total supply.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- Node.js and npm
- Truffle or Hardhat (for deploying contracts)
- Ganache (for local blockchain simulation)
- MetaMask (for interacting with the blockchain)
